Login Process: The login process was thoroughly tested to ensure users can successfully log in with valid credentials. Test cases were designed to verify various scenarios such as successful login with correct credentials, unsuccessful login with incorrect credentials, and handling of error messages.

Home Screen Navigation: Test cases were created to validate the process of adding products to the shopping cart. This included testing different scenarios such as adding items to the cart and removing items from the cart, verifying the cart subtotal, and ensuring the correct quantity and price are reflected.

Checkout Process: The checkout process was thoroughly tested to ensure a seamless experience for users. Test cases were designed to validate each step of the checkout process, including entering required fields, and completing the purchase.

Overall, the project aimed to ensure the functionality, usability, and reliability of the SauceDemo website, providing users with a smooth and satisfactory shopping experience from login to checkout.


## Demo for Parallel execution
## Key Features

Thread Management with DriverManager: The automation code includes a DriverManager file responsible for controlling the threads of the drivers. This feature ensures efficient utilization of resources by managing the lifecycle of driver instances, including initialization, usage, and cleanup, thereby optimizing test execution.

Utilities Class for POM Model: A Utilities class has been implemented to manage Java code utilized within the Page Object Model (POM). This feature encapsulates commonly used methods and functionalities, promoting code reusability, maintainability, and scalability across different pages and tests within the framework.


Listener Class for Handling Failed Test Cases:
The framework incorporates a Listener class dedicated to managing failed test cases. This feature enables the automatic capture of failed test cases, providing enhanced visibility into test execution results. Additionally, it facilitates immediate actions or interventions, such as logging, reporting, or custom error handling, to mitigate and address test failures effectively.
